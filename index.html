				This paper introduces the Generative Sample Map (GESAM), a novel two-stage unsupervised learning framework capable of generating high-quality and expressive audio samples for music production. Recent generative approaches based on language models rely on text prompts as conditions. However, fine nuances in musical audio samples can hardly be described in the modality of text. For addressing this shortcoming, we propose to learn a highly descriptive latent 2D audio map by a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) which is then utilized for conditioning a Transformer model. We demonstrate the Transformer model's ability to achieve high generation quality and compare its performance against two baseline models. By selecting points on the map that compresses the manifold of the audio training set into 2D, we enable a more natural interaction with the model. We showcase this capability through an interactive demo interface, which is accessible on this website.

This article introduces a Transformer-based model capable of generating high quality audio samples for music production by conditioning the model with a coordinate on a 2d sample map. 

Especially the audio domain is difficult for generative models because of long sequence lengths. Especially for music production it is hard because samples have to have a high quality to be used within songs.

State of the art approaches primarily condition sound by a text embedding which is not very suitable for musical sample generation since samples differ by nuances that can not be expressed by text. 
It is more natural for the human to describe an abstract thing with words as 'closer to this' or 'I want something more in this direction'. 

To achieve this we conditioned a transformer with a trained 2d embedding for querying audio samples more intuitively and efficient. 

By our results, which we demonstrate by an interactive web-demo (LINK), we hope to broaden the perspective on how to query audio samples and how a future digital audio workstation could be.
